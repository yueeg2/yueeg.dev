## Atomic

## Flux (React) - 2014
centralized Dispatcher, Store, Action and View 

+ View - Render UI by the new update of View, notified by Store.
+ Action - Dispatch after handling all events notified by View
  + payload: 
    ```
    {
    actionType: "",
      data: {
          title: "Understanding Flux step by step",
          author: "Sharvin"
      }
    }
    ```
+ Dispatcher - Dispatch Action with payload to Store
+ Store - Store with different actionType (based on payload), use Node.EventEmitter to update and notify.

Flux 對比於 MVC 的前端架構有以下幾個優點：

+ 改善資料的一致性 (better data-handling strategy as apps grow larger and more complicated)
+ 更容易找出哪裡有 bug，容易修改 (one-way data flow)
+ 寫出更好的 unit tests

## MVC - 2003

Model, View, and Controller
